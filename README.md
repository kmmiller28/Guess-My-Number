# Guess My Number

##Task

This is a Visual Basic solution that plays a number guessing game with the user. The program will randomly generate a value between one and ten, and will compare the userâ€™s guess to this value. The program will give the user five attempts to guess the correct number. When the user exits the game, the program will display the percentage of guesses that were correct. This program uses counters and accumulators.

##Summary

This program was built using Visual Basic and I chose to use Visual Studio to accomplish this task due to its powerful developer tooling.

##Functionality

This program starts out by asking the user to enter their guess up to five times. The program is implemented by multiple If and If/Else statements to calcualte necessary information. If they guessed wrong, the program will output a message stating to try again. The user can play however many times they want, but when they push the Exit button, it will give the total number of guesses as well as the percentage of guesses that were correct.
